title: Preferred Name (v2)

#### Q: Hi Jorge, I noticed your directory information has been updated to Jennifer. What's going on?

**A:** Thank you for noticing! I've requested a preferred name to be added in my institutional account. As you may or may not be aware, I'm currently in a transitory period where a more feminine name would be preferable. It's possible that this could be a premature move, but as we are all preparing to transition into a more in-person setting, I thought this would be the most appropriate time. 

<br />

#### Q: Is Jennifer your new name now?

**A:** That's a complicated question. Legally no, but I would much rather you refer to me by Jennifer (and gender me properly in the process) than Jorge. I'm hoping that by having most of my online presence reflect this name, it'll help everyone acclimate better to the situation. I'm not sure if this is the name I'll be sticking with, since I don't have a strong attachment to it, but I hope it grows on me. The legal process is tedious and  takes time, so I'll only go through it once I'm sure about the name.

#### Q: I have a name recommendation for you.

**A:** Hold on there, I have standards & guidelines to follow! I'm basically looking at names that can be read and written in English and Spanish the same way. Bonus points if it starts with a 'j' or you can make nicknames out of it. Jennifer was a very good alternative because it allowed me to keep my 'jadorno' profiles I have scattered across the web, but I welcome your suggestion.
